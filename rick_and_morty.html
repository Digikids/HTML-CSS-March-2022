       <p>Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by<br>
        Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block,<br>
        Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick<br>

        Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. Since its debut, the series<br>
        has received critical acclaim for its originality, creativity and humor.<br>
