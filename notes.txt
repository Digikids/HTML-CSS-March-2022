What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading",
    "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Start tag	Element content	End tag
<h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	   My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>	none	none

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element).
These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!

HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags,
but W3C recommends lowercase in HTML, and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTM

HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading.

Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages.
Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the
document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2>
headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add
some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

HTML Styles
The HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

The HTML Style Attribute
Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.

The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:

<tagname style="property:value;">
The property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value

Background Color
The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.

Example
Set the background color for a page to powderblue:

<body style="background-color:powderblue;">

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>

Text Color
The CSS color property defines the text color for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

Fonts
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p>

Text Size
The CSS font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p>

Text Alignment
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

HTML <b> and <strong> Elements
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

Example
<b>This text is bold</b>

The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance.
The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

Example
<strong>This text is important!</strong>

HTML <i> and <em> Elements
The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The
content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another
language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

Example
<i>This text is italic</i>
The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

Example
<em>This text is emphasized</em>

HTML <small> Element
The HTML <small> element defines smaller text:

Example
<small>This is some smaller text.</small>
HTML <mark> Element
The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:

Example
<p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
HTML <del> Element
The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document.
Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text:

Example
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>
HTML <ins> Element
The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document.
Browsers will usually underline inserted text:

Example
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
HTML <sub> Element
The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a
character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.
Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:

Example
<p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
HTML <sup> Element
The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a
character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript
text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]:

Example
<p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>

HTML Quotation and Citation Elements
In this chapter we will go through the <blockquote>,<q>, <abbr>, <address>, <cite>, and <bdo> HTML elements.

Example
Here is a quote from WWF's website:

For nearly 60 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. The world's
leading conservation organization, WWF works in 100 countries
and is supported by more than one million members in the United States
and close to five million globally.

HTML <blockquote> for Quotations
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.

Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

Example
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
close to 5 million globally.
</blockquote>

HTML <q> for Short Quotations
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.

Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

Example
<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
