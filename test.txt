Rick and Morty is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by
Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon for Cartoon Network's nighttime programming block,
Adult Swim. The series follows the misadventures of cynical mad scientist Rick
Sanchez and his good-hearted, but fretful grandson Morty Smith, who split their
time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures.

Roiland voices the eponymous characters, with Chris Parnell, Spencer Grammer and
Sarah Chalke voicing the rest of Rick and Morty's family. The series originated
from an animated short parody film of Back to the Future, created by Roiland for
Channel 101, a short film festival co-founded by Harmon. Since its debut, the series
has received critical acclaim for its originality, creativity and humor.

The fifth season premiered on June 20, 2021, and consisted of ten episodes.
A sixth season was confirmed as part of a long-term deal in May 2018 that ordered
70 new episodes over an unspecified number of seasons.
