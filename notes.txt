What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading",
    "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

Comments are programmer readable annotations that cannot be executed
<!--comments go here -->

What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Start tag	Element content	End tag
<h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	   My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>	none	none

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element).
These elements are called empty elements.
Empty elements do not have an end tag!

HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags,
but I would recommends lowercase in HTML,
and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTM

HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading.
<h6> defines the least important heading.

Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and
content of your web pages.
Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the
document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2>
headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add
some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

HTML Styles
-> Inline styling
-> External styling
The HTML style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

The HTML Style Attribute
Setting the style of an HTML element, can be done with the style attribute.

The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:

<tagname style="property:value;">
The property is a CSS property. The value is a CSS value

Background Color
The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.

Example
Set the background color for a page to powderblue:

<body style="background-color:powderblue;">

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>

Text Color
The CSS color property defines the text color for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>

Fonts
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p>

Text Size
The CSS font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p>

Text Alignment
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:

Example
<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>

HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

Background Color
You can set the background color for HTML elements

Example
<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">Lorem ipsum...</p>

Border Color
You can set the color of borders:

Hello World
Hello World
Hello World
Example
<h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Hello World</h1>

Example
<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">...</h1>

RGB Color Values
In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:

rgb(red, green, blue)

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color with a value between 0 and 255.

This means that there are 256 x 256 x 256 = 16777216 possible colors!

For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255),
and the other two (green and blue) are set to 0.

Another example, rgb(0, 255, 0) is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (255),
and the other two (red and blue) are set to 0.

To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).

To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).


<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text

HTML <b> and <strong> Elements
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

Example
<b>This text is bold</b>

The HTML <strong> element defines text with strong importance.
The content inside is typically displayed in bold.

Example
<strong>This text is important!</strong>

HTML <i> and <em> Elements
The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The
content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another
language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

Example
<i>This text is italic</i>
The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

Example
<em>This text is emphasized</em>

HTML <small> Element
The HTML <small> element defines smaller text:

Example
<small>This is some smaller text.</small>
HTML <mark> Element
The HTML <mark> element defines text that should be marked or highlighted:

Example
<p>Do not forget to buy <mark>milk</mark> today.</p>
HTML <del> Element
The HTML <del> element defines text that has been deleted from a document.
Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text:

Example
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> red.</p>
HTML <ins> Element
The HTML <ins> element defines a text that has been inserted into a document.
Browsers will usually underline inserted text:

Example
<p>My favorite color is <del>blue</del> <ins>red</ins>.</p>
HTML <sub> Element
The HTML <sub> element defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a
character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.
Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H2O:

Example
<p>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</p>
HTML <sup> Element
The HTML <sup> element defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a
character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Superscript
text can be used for footnotes, like WWW[1]:

Example
<p>This is <sup>superscripted</sup> text.</p>

HTML Quotation and Citation Elements
In this chapter we will go through the <blockquote>,<q>, <abbr>, <address>, <cite>, and <bdo> HTML elements.

Example
Here is a quote from WWF's website:

For nearly 60 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. The world's
leading conservation organization, WWF works in 100 countries
and is supported by more than one million members in the United States
and close to five million globally.

HTML <blockquote> for Quotations
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.

Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

Example
<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
The world's leading conservation organization,
WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
1.2 million members in the United States and
close to 5 million globally.
</blockquote>

HTML <q> for Short Quotations
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.

Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

Example
<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>

HTML Comments
HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

HTML Comment Tag
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:

<!-- Write your comments here -->
Notice that there is an exclamation point (!) in the start tag, but not in the end tag.

Note: Comments are not displayed by the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

Add Comments
With comments you can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code:

Example
<!-- This is a comment -->

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

<!-- Remember to add more information here -


HTML Styles - CSS

What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements,
how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used,
different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply
to all children elements within the parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue",
all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color
(unless you specify something else)!

Using CSS
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. 



Inline CSS
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and 
the text color of the <p> element to red:

Example
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>

Internal CSS
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page,
within a <style> element.

The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements
(on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red.
In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


External CSS
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

The external style sheet can be written in any text editor.
The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.

Here is what the "styles.css" file looks like:

"styles.css":
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}

CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes
Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them later.

The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.

The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.

The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.

CSS Border
The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.

Tip: You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements.

Example
Use of CSS border property: 

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
}

CSS Padding
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.

Example
Use of CSS border and padding properties:

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  padding: 30px;
}

CSS Margin
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.

Example
Use of CSS border and margin properties:

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  margin: 50px;
}

Link to External CSS
External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

Example
This example uses a full URL to link to a style sheet:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

<a href="url">link text</a>
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute,
which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

Example
This example shows how to create a link to Digikids.com:

<a href="https://www.Digikids.com/">Visit Digikids.com!</a>

By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look!

HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window.
To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

Example
Use target="_blank" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab:

Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is 
specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

Example
<h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.digikids.co.ke/">School</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>
<p><a href="i">HTML Images</a></p>
<p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>

Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's 
email program (to let them send a new email):

Example
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:

Example
<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

HTML Link Colors
By default, a link will appear like this (in all browsers):

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
You can change the link state colors, by using CSS:

Example
Here, an unvisited link will be green with no underline. 
A visited link will be pink with no underline. 
An active link will be yellow and underlined. 
In addition, when mousing over a link (a:hover) it will become red and underlined:

<style>
a:link {
  color: green;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:visited {
  color: pink;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: none;
}

a:hover {
  color: red;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}

a:active {
  color: yellow;
  background-color: transparent;
  text-decoration: underline;
}
</style>

Link Buttons
A link can also be styled as a button, by using CSS:

This is a link
Example
<style>
a:link, a:visited {
  background-color: #f44336;
  color: white;
  padding: 15px 25px;
  text-align: center;
  text-decoration: none;
  display: inline-block;
}

a:hover, a:active {
  background-color: red;
}
</style>

HTML Images Syntax
The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. 
The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

The <img> tag has two required attributes:

src - Specifies the path to the image
alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image
Syntax
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">
The src Attribute
The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

Note: When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image 
from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image 
actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors 
will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the 
browser cannot find the image.

Example
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, 
if the user for some reason cannot view it (because of slow connection, 
an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).

The value of the alt attribute should describe the image:

Example
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">

Image Size - Width and Height
You can use the style attribute to specify the width and height of an image.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" style="width:500px;height:600px;">

Width and Height, or Style?
The width, height, and style attributes are all valid in HTML.

However, we suggest using the style attribute. It prevents styles sheets from changing the size of images:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
img {
  width: 100%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="128" height="128">

<img src="html5.gif" alt="HTML5 Icon" style="width:128px;height:128px;">

</body>
</html>

Images on Another Server/Website
Some web sites point to an image on another server.

To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:

Example
<img src="https://www.im1.jpg" alt="Digikids.com">

Background Image on a HTML element
To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute
and the CSS background-image property:

Example
Add a background image on a HTML element:

<p style="background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');">

You can also specify the background image in the <style> element, in the <head> section:

Example
Specify the background image in the <style> element:

<style>
p {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>

Background Image on a Page
If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background
image on the <body> element:

Example
Add a background image for the entire page:

<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>

Background Image on a Page
If you want the entire page to have a background image, you must specify the background
image on the <body> element:

Example
Add a background image for the entire page:

<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>
Background Repeat
If the background image is smaller than the element, 
the image will repeat itself, horizontally and vertically, 
until it reaches the end of the element:

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
}
</style>
To avoid the background image from repeating itself, set the background-repeat property to no-repeat.

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('example_img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
</style>
Background Cover
If you want the background image to cover the entire element, 
you can set the background-size property to cover.

Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, 
set the background-attachment property to fixed:

This way, the background image will cover the entire element, 
with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: cover;
}
</style>
Background Stretch
If you want the background image to stretch to fit the entire element, 
you can set the background-size property to 100% 100%:

Try resizing the browser window, and you will see that the image will stretch, 
but always cover the entire element.

Example
<style>
body {
  background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-attachment: fixed;
  background-size: 100% 100%;
}
</style>


HTML tables allow web developers to arrange data into rows and columns.

Example
Company	                Contact	                    Country
Alfreds Futterkiste	    Maria Anders	                Germany
Centro comercial M      octezuma	Francisco Chang	    Mexico
Ernst Handel	          Roland Mendel	              Austria
Island Trading	        Helen Bennett	              UK
Laughing Bacchus        Winecellars	Yoshi 	        Canada
Magazzini Alimentari    Riuniti	Giovanni 	          Italy

Table Cells
Each table cell is defined by a <td> and a </td> tag.

td stands for table data.

Everything between <td> and </td> are the content of the table cell.

Table Rows
Each table row starts with a <tr> and end with a </tr> tag.

HTML Table Tags
Tag	     Description
<table>	 Defines a table
<th>	   Defines a header cell in a table
<tr>	   Defines a row in a table
<td>	   Defines a cell in a table
<caption>	Defines a table caption
<colgroup>	Specifies a group of one or more columns in a table for formatting
<col>	Specifies column properties for each column within a <colgroup> element
<thead>	Groups the header content in a table
<tbody>	Groups the body content in a table
<tfoot>	Groups the footer content in a table

How To Add a Border
When you add a border to a table, you also add borders around each table cell:

To add a border, use the CSS border property on table, th, and td elements:
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
}

Collapsed Table Borders
To avoid having double borders like in the example above, set
the CSS border-collapse property to collapse.

This will make the borders collapse into a single border:
Example
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

Style Table Borders
If you set a background color of each cell, and give the border a
white color (the same as the document background), you get the impression of an invisible border:

table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid white;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}
th, td {
  background-color: #96D4D4;
}

Round Table Borders
With the border-radius property, the borders get rounded corners:

Example
table, th, td {
  border: 1px solid black;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

Border Color
With the border-color property, you can set the color of the border.
Example
 th, td {
  border-color: #96D4D4;
}

HTML Table Width
To set the width of a table, add the style attribute to the <table> element
Set the width of the table to 100%:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

o set the size of a specific column, add the style attribute on a <th> or <td> element:

Example
Set the width of the first column to 70%:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th style="width:70%">Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>

To set the height of a specific row, add the style attribute on a table row element:

Example
Set the height of the second row to 200 pixels:

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr style="height:200px">
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>
