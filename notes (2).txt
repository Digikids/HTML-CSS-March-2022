What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading",
    "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

Comments are programmer readable annotations that cannot be executed

What is an HTML Element?
An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag

<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
Start tag	Element content	End tag
<h1>	My First Heading	</h1>
<p>	   My first paragraph.	</p>
<br>	none	none

Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element).
These elements are called empty elements.
Empty elements do not have an end tag!

HTML is Not Case Sensitive
HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
The HTML standard does not require lowercase tags,
but I would recommends lowercase in HTML,
and demands lowercase for stricter document types like XHTM

HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading.
<h6> defines the least important heading.

Headings Are Important
Search engines use the headings to index the structure and
content of your web pages.
Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the
document structure.

<h1> headings should be used for main headings, followed by <h2>
headings, then the less important <h3>, and so on.

HTML Paragraphs
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add
some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.
Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
